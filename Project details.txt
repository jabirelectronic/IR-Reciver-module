(Infrared receiver with remote control tester)

With the help of this module, you can test all infrared controllers.
A digital output with 5V voltage is also provided for use in electronic circuits (Arduino, microcontrollers) by the header pin.
The input voltage is 6 to 18 volts, which is supplied through a standard jack.

If you don't use an external power supply, you can connect a 5V voltage and a ground to the Pin_header and use the middle pin as digital data.
